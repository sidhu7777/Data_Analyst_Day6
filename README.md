# SQL Database Analysis and Reporting Project
This project consists of a structured collection of SQL scripts designed to perform database initialization, exploration, analysis, and reporting tasks. It guides the user through a complete workflow starting from database setup to complex data-driven insights.

# Project Overview
The project is organized into multiple stages:

Database Initialization: Create and populate the base database schema.

Data Exploration: Understand the database dimensions, measures, and date ranges.

Analytical Queries: Perform magnitude, ranking, change-over-time, and cumulative analyses.

Segmentation and Performance Analysis: Analyze data subsets and performance metrics.

Reporting: Generate focused reports for customers and products.

Each SQL script is modular, focusing on a specific part of the exploration or analysis process.

# How to Use
Start by executing scripts/00_init_database.sql to initialize the database structure and sample data.

Proceed sequentially through the scripts/ folder to perform various exploration and analysis tasks.

Customize queries if needed based on your SQL database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Use the reporting scripts to extract customer-level and product-level insights.
